There is no must have for a system using i-MSCP. This is only a recommendation:

================================================================================
3) Introduction
---------------
i-MSCP delivers a complete hosting automation appliance by offering significant
security, total-cost-of-ownership, and performance advantages over competing
commercial solutions.

With i-MSCP you can configure your server and applications, create user with
domains with a few point-and-click operations that take less than a minute.
There is no limit to the number of resellers, users and domains that can be
created. The core of i-MSCP are 3 easy-to-use, web-based control panels. i-MSCP
provides graphic user interfaces for the administrators, resellers and users.

================================================================================
4) SiteWide Mail protection solution
------------------------------------

Since i-MSCP 1.0.0, both setup and update scripts are able to configure
a complete sitewide mail protection solution using Amavisd-new, SpamAssassin,
ClamAv and some other services such as razor...

If you want activate this solution, you should edit the imscp.conf file before
install/update i-MSCP Omega to activate the services that are part of this
solution.

You can also disable the mail protection solution by setting the proper values
to 'no' in the imscp.conf file (imscp.old.conf when update), and by running
again the i-MSCP Omega update script.

See the comments in the imscp.conf file for more information.

WARNING: Implementation of this solution is still experimental. You are warned!

================================================================================
5) Installation
---------------
First, make sure you are logged in as root.

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:

	# cd /usr/local/src
	# tar xjvf imscp-1.0.0.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:

	# cd ./imscp-1.0.0

3. Install the required repositories:

	# sh ./docs/OpenSuse/repositories.sh add

Note: For all questions, answer "a" (trust always).

4. install the required packages:

	First, update your distribution:
	# zypper dup

	# zypper in $(cat ./docs/OpenSuse/bin-packages)

5. Install the required Perl packages:

	First, update CPAN:
	# cpan CPAN

	# cpan $(cat ./docs/OpenSuse/perl-packages)

6. (optional) Check the imscp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

7. Build the System by using make:

	# ./imscp-build

8. Copy all the directories into your system (you may make backups before):

	# cp -RLv /tmp/imscp/* /

9. Start MySQL, if it not already running:

	# rcmysql restart

10. Change or create MySQL root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root
	login remotely, remove test database (and access to it), reload privilege
	tables:

	# mysql_secure_installation

11. Maybe empty the folder /etc/skel - otherwise you'll have all the
	files/folders in the home folders:

	# cp -a /etc/skel /etc/skel.bkp
	# rm -r /etc/skel && mkdir /etc/skel

12. Now it's time to set up i-MSCP. Change into the engine directory and start
	the engine setup:

	# cd /srv/www/imscp/engine/setup
	# perl imscp-setup

	# rm -r /etc/skel && mv /etc/skel.bkp /etc/skel
